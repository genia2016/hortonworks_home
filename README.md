# hortonworks_home


This is a project to demo how to use python 2, python3 and R on the same page, which is based on the latest hortonworks sandbox by installation Anaconda's python 3 and 2, as well R kernal, so we can do data science project to combine python 2, 3 and R on the same notebook page.

I installed Hortonworks Sandbox on my desktop on the VMWare and installed anaconda3. You are welcome to try them out!
